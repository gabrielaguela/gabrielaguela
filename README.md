### Hi there, I'm Gabriela Guel 👋
**Senior Backend Developer | Legacy Systems Architect | PhD**

---

### 🔒 Why is this profile mostly empty of code?

**Short answer:** Government Security and Confidentiality.

For the past **18 years**, I have served as a **Lead Systems Architect for the State Government of Zacatecas (Secretariat of Public Function)** in Mexico. 

The software I architect and maintain handles:
* **State-wide Auditing Systems** (Sensitive financial data).
* **Public Tender Platforms** (Legally binding processes).
* **Patrimonial Declarations** for public servants across the state.

Due to strict **Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)** and government data protection protocols, the source code for these 27+ mission-critical systems is **classified and proprietary**. I cannot host it on a public repository.

### 🏛️ What I Build (Architecture over Snippets)

Instead of public code, I offer a track record of **Stability and Scale** in the Public Sector:

* **Zero-Downtime Operations:** Managing high-availability infrastructure for citizen-facing services.
* **Legacy Modernization:** Migrated massive monolithic systems from native PHP to **Laravel/PHP 8**.
* **Performance Engineering:** Optimized SQL Server queries achieving **80% reduction** in execution times for State Transparency Portals.
* **Infrastructure:** Direct administration of 12+ Linux/Windows servers (On-Premise).

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Backend:** PHP 8, Laravel, C# .NET
* **Databases:** MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server (Optimization & Stored Procedures)
* **Infrastructure:** Linux (CentOS/Ubuntu), Windows Server, Apache/Nginx
* **Architecture:** Monolithic (for cost-efficiency), REST/SOAP APIs, Queues & Jobs
